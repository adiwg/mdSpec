# mdSpec

https://www.adiwg.org/mdSpec

The primary purpose of this application is to help write content
specifications for metadata. However, it probably could be used to write a
simple specification for other things, too.

mdSpec can be used to build a hierarchy of modules and components. Each
module or component may be assigned requirements which may be fulfilled by
child components. The hierarchy may be navigated using the tree in the sidebar.

This README outlines the details of collaborating on this Ember application.
